WHO Mortality Data base documentation  

The users' attention is brought to the fact that some data might differ from those as published by the countries.  This is mainly because (a) WHO uses standard classifications to present the data  (b) some countries do not implement the ICD10 updates and (c) also the WHO Mortality Data base is regularly updated.

Part 1: Background and file descriptions

* Background: 

The data available for download from this web site are official national statistics in the sense that they have been transmitted to the World Health Organization by the competent authorities of the countries concerned.

The WHO Mortality Data base comprises deaths registered in national vital registration systems, with underlying cause of death as coded by the relevant national authority. Underlying cause of death is defined as “the disease or injury which initiated the train of morbid events leading directly to death, or the circumstances of the accident or violence which produced the fatal injury” in accordance with the rules of the International Classification of Diseases. 

The database contains number of deaths by country, year, sex, age group and cause of death as far back from 1950. Data are included only for countries reporting data properly coded according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD).

* System requirements and installation: 

The database is available for PC.  At least 500 MB of free space is required to download and install the data set to the user’s PC.  The data set is distributed in compressed form. All the files are in ASCII format only (csv files with comma separated values); however their format allows for easy importing into any Data Base Management System (DBMS), for e.g. Microsoft Access, SPSS, STATA, SAS. Users should have the necessary knowledge to operate a DBMS for a comprehensive use of the database. Instructions for importing the csv files into STATA and SAS are listed in Annex Table 3. However users are strongly recommended not to try to import the data into spreadsheets because of the excessive number of records.  There are over 2 million records in one data  file.

* Description of the data files:

MortIcd07.zip: mortality data aggregated according to the Lists A and B of the 7th revision of the ICD . Total records: 281,749 (excluding first row of field names)

MortIcd08.zip: mortality data aggregated according to the Lists A and B of the 8th revision of the ICD. Total records 380,627 (excluding first row of field names).

MortIcd09.zip: mortality data aggregated according to the Basic Tabulation List (BTL) of the 9th revision of the ICD. Total records 899,470 (excluding first row of field names)

MortIcd10.zip: mortality data according to the 10th revision of the ICD, either with 3 characters, 4 characters ICD 10 codes or the tabulation list. (excluding first row of field names). 

For frequent users:  This file is now split into 5 parts (all mutually exclusive):  
1. Morticd10_part1 (1,022,017 records) – ICD-10 data up to 2002
2. Morticd10_part2 (  958,820 records)  – ICD-10 data for 2003-2007
3. Morticd10_part3 (1,045,311 records) – ICD-10 data for 2008-2012
4. Morticd10_part4 (   876,997 records) – ICD-10 data for 2013-2016
5. Morticd10_part5 (   811,508 records) – ICD-10 data for 2017 onwards

excluding first row of field names


Pop.zip:  reference population and live births. Note population and live births are both in units. Population figures are mid-year population.  Total records 9,999 (excluding first row of field names).  


Country_codes.zip: Country codes and names. Total records 227 (excluding first row of field names)

Availability.zip: List of countries-years included in the data base for mortality and population data. This is an Excel file with two worksheets.

Note that the fields “Admin1”, “Subdiv”, “List”, “Cause”, “Frmat” and “IM_Frmat” should be treated as characters.  The other fields can be treated as numerical variables.

Notes.zip:  Notes related to data for some countries-years.  Total records 115 (excluding first row of field names)

Instructions for importing the CSV data files into STATA:

After all files download completed, decompress all the files and store them into a directory.  Important: add the extension “csv” at the name of each file.

How to import csv file into STATA: 

1. Save the csv file onto a drive on your computer, note the full path of document.  
a. Take as example file “morticd10.csv” and save it in folder: “D:\My documents”.  Hence full path name is:  “D:\My documents\morticd10.csv”
2. Open STATA
3. Type in command “insheet using” + full path name from 1a  =
insheet using “D:\My documents\ morticd10.csv”
Run the command and the data will be imported into STATA.

Annex 4

Conditions on the use of the WHO Mortality database (MDB)
 
The data available on this web site comprise deaths registered in national vital registration systems, with underlying cause of death as coded by the relevant national authority. These data are official national statistics in the sense that they have been transmitted to the World Health Organization by the competent authorities of the countries concerned. Each Member State reports population data along with their mortality data, for the population covered by the death registration system. Where this is a subset of the national population, the data is labelled accordingly in the WHO Mortality Database, e.g. Brazil (North and North-east) or Paraguay (reporting areas). However, the completeness of death registration may also be less than 100% for the specified registration population. 

Note that vital registration data may be 100% complete for the population covered, but not include full coverage of deaths in the country. Caution should therefore be taken when doing inter-country comparisons.

Death registration coverage and cross-national differences in coding practices, particularly in the use of codes for ill-defined and unknown causes, must also be taken into account to validly compare mortality rates for specific causes across countries. 

The designations employed and the presentation of material in the MDB do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of the World Health Organization or other parties involved in the MDB concerning the legal status of any country, territory or area, its authorities, its current or former official name, or the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. Accordingly: a) strictly for purposes of statistical use, denominations are used which, although applicable at one particular time, may not reflect correct terminology at some other point in the historical context in which they are so used; b) references to "former" entities refer to countries that formerly existed under those names, or abbreviations; and c) in some cases, denominations are used to refer to countries as they currently exist and, when used with respect to data relating to before the existence of these countries as independent states, to sub-national entities of formerly existing larger countries.

WHO asks users to cooperate in the provision of electronically transmitted data by adhering to the following guidelines:-

(a) Material drawn from the MDB for publication must be accompanied by an acknowledgment of WHO as the source and a disclaimer crediting analyses, interpretations or conclusions to the author of the published data and not to WHO, which is responsible only for the provision of the original information.

(b) Users wishing to publish a technical description or qualification of the data will make a reasonable effort to ensure that it is not inconsistent with any published by WHO.

(c) Recipients of electronically transmitted data wishing to, or asked to make these, or copies thereof available to a third party are asked to refer such party to WHO, who will transmit the data directly accompanied with the necessary documentation. This will prevent circulation of out-of-date data, as the MDB is updated regularly. 

It should be noted that these data are transmitted on the understanding that no use will be made of them for commercial purposes and that no such permission or right to use may be implied thereby.

Part 3: Frequently asked questions

Q.  What are the sources of the cause-of-death statistics?
A.  The cause-of-death statistics are generally from country civil registration systems. When a death occurs, this event is registered at the local civil registry with information on the cause of death. The information is then compiled by the national authority and submitted to WHO every year.

Q.  Are the deaths medically-certified?
A.  WHO only publishes here the medically-certified deaths.  Diagnoses on causes of death by lay people are not included.

Q.  If the data is incomplete, have the data been adjusted for incompleteness?
A.  The data presented are as submitted by the countries to WHO.  No adjustment has been made to account for incompleteness.

Q. Where can I obtain information on data completeness and quality?
A.  Information on data completeness and quality by country are available on this web site https://platform.who.int/mortality/about/data-quality

Q.  What kind of corrections have been made to the data?
A.  WHO verifies that the data submitted are coded with the official ICD codes. If non-official codes are used, they would be replaced with the most appropriate official codes. 

Q. How are the number of deaths and population presented?  
A. They are all shown as absolute numbers.

Q. Why are population data missing for some countries-years and where can I find other sources of population data?
A. Some countries do not report population data to WHO.  Users can find population estimates from the United Nations web site http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp


Q.  The list of countries does not seem to include all the countries in the world.  What are the reasons?
A.  Simply because some countries do not report mortality data to WHO.  However for some countries, the data they sent to WHO are not in standard ICD codes or do not have ICD codes, so they cannot be shown here. In many low-resourced countries,  the cause-of-death information is difficult to obtain, mainly because the system for recording such information is not functioning or inexistent.  In addition one of the big problems is the lack of medical certifiers  to complete the death certificates.





Q. Are the data for the countries listed mutually exclusive?
A. Except United Kingdom which include data for England and Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland which are also presented separately, all the other data are mutually exclusive, for e.g. Martinique, Guadeloupe are not included in France. Care should be taken when treating data of former entities which split up or merged together to form new entities. 

Q. Why are some latest years of data missing?
A. Countries usually submit data to WHO within 12-18 months after the closure of their records for the calendar year.  Data checking, compilation and verification takes considerable time at the country level.
